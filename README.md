# 4-Bit-Arithmetic-Logic-Unit-ALU-Implementation
This repository contains the implementation of a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) developed as a part of the digital logic design course. An ALU is a fundamental component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) responsible for performing arithmetic and logic operations on input data.
